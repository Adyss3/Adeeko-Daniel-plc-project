# Adeeko-Daniel-plc-project
This is the first frontend landing page project given to me by plurarlcode academy
Fully responsive brainwave landing page 
Took me 2 weeks to get it done considering i was also learning javascript at this time
It is a basic landing page designed starting from the navbar to the footer.the code base is very easy to understand ,i used bootsrap with an internal css styling just wanted to try it,for a more professional website i wont do that i would prefer seperating the css externally.
